# Flight Status Classification Model using Logistic Regression
Created a machine learning classification project. This project applies Logistic Regression to predict flight staus outcomes using historical airline data. The goal was to to practice a complete machine learning classification workflow from data preparation to model evaluation.

Project Workflow:
* Loaded and explored a real-world flight dataset (2,200+ records)
* Cleaned and transformed features, including encoding categorical variables such as carrier, origin, and destination
* Built a logistic regression classifier using Scikit-Learn
* Split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate generalization
* Measured performance using accuracy and confusion matrices

Results:
The model achieved:
* Training Accuracy: 67.5%
* Test Accuracy: 71.6%
The results show reasonable predictive performance and demonstrate how structured features like departure time, distance, and carrier contribute to flight outcome prediction.
